# ThreadedTaskReminder

**ThreadedTaskReminder** is a feature-rich C# application designed to manage reminders efficiently using advanced multithreading and task-based programming techniques. This project focuses on providing a robust and scalable reminder system by leveraging the following technologies and features:

## Key Features
- **Task-Based Multithreading**:  
  Each reminder is managed as an independent task, ensuring optimal concurrency and responsiveness.

- **Cancellation Token Support**:  
  Gracefully handle task cancellation for reminders when needed.

- **Thread Pool Management**:  
  Efficiently manage threads to balance performance and resource usage.

- **Synchronization Mechanisms**:  
  - **Locks**: Ensure thread-safe operations for shared resources.  
  - **Semaphore**: Manage concurrent access to system resources.

- **Reminder Management**:  
  - Add, update, delete, and retrieve reminders.  
  - **Snooze Reminders**: Temporarily postpone reminders for a specified period and reschedule notifications accordingly.  
  - **Mark as Complete**: Mark reminders as completed once the task is done to avoid further notifications.

- **Notification System**:  
  Send timely notifications to alert users about their scheduled reminders.

- **Scalable Architecture**:  
  Built with thread safety and scalability in mind, capable of handling multiple reminders simultaneously.

## How It Works
- Each reminder is treated as an independent task, running in a controlled threading environment.
- Notifications alert users about reminders, with the ability to take immediate **actions**, such as:
  - **Snooze**: Delay the reminder and reschedule it for a later time.
  - **Complete**: Mark the reminder as done to prevent further notifications.
- Features like snooze, complete, and notifications are processed using advanced synchronization and task management techniques to avoid conflicts or resource contention.

## Technologies Used
- **C# .NET Framework**
- **Tasks and Threading**: For concurrent execution.
- **CancellationToken**: To manage and stop tasks gracefully.
- **ThreadPool**: For efficient resource management.
- **Locks and Semaphores**: For synchronization and thread safety.
